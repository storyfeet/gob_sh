RuShell
======

A Shell built in rust build around the bogobble parser system.

It has a few features not many shells have:

* syntax and error highlighting as you type.
* multiline edits 
* raw string input 

There is still plenty to do, but many things work

install using "cargo install ru\_shell" 

try it

```text
let RU_PROMPT=r#"Hello \e33m$PWD\n>>\e0m"#

for a in * {
echo A is $a 
}

```
